# Sprint 01 Goals

## Primary Goal

**Solidify core card gameplay mechanics and polish the unique drag-and-drop targeting system.**

## Success Criteria

By the end of this sprint, we should have:

1. ✅ A fully functional core game loop (play cards, use abilities, take turns)
2. ✅ Polished drag-and-drop targeting that feels intuitive
3. ✅ Clear visual feedback for valid/invalid targets
4. ✅ Basic win/lose conditions working

## Key Focus Areas

### 1. Targeting System Polish
The drag-and-drop targeting is what makes this game unique:
- Drag to empty space → Play unit
- Drag to friendly unit → Use defensive ability
- Drag to opponent unit → Use offensive ability

This needs to feel smooth and provide clear feedback.

### 2. Game State Completeness
Ensure the core loop is complete:
- Turn start → Main phase → Turn end
- Mana economy working correctly
- Summoning sickness properly enforced
- Card tapping/untapping working

### 3. Foundation for Future Features
Set up clean architecture to support:
- More ability types
- Status effects
- Multiplayer sync

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- New card designs/art
- Audio/music implementation
- Complex AI opponent
- Deck building features
